# A antique book bot
This antique book bot is a bot that displays the price of the desired book taken from specific antique stores. The websites are opened with the _selenium_ library, and results are displayed with _PySimpleGUI_.

This is just a fast one-person hobby project, so the commenting and naming of variables isn't that well thought. 

!! Currently, this bot searches books only from https://www.antikvaari.fi/, and I haven't implemented the complete error checks !!
